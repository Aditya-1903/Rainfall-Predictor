The purpose of this project is to develop a Logistic Regression Model to predict rainfall in Australia with the help of a dataset available in Kaggle. 
The task was to predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable from the dataset.
Our model was trained to a satisfactory accuracy of 84%.
